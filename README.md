# Fall2024CAP
Fall 2024 Capstone Project

## Progress Update: 09/09/2024

### [Web Framework]

1. **Introduction**: 
   I have chosen to work on a website/webapp using a web framework. At the moment the focus of this project is toward Cybersecurity.

2. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   For this week, I focused on setting up the basic environment:
   - Using Next.js I have installed the following dependencies: react, eact-dom, next
   
   Installing devDependencies:
   - postcss
   - tailwindcss
   - eslint
   - eslint-config-next.

   All were installed by running the command: `npx create-next-app@latest capstone-project`.

3. **Hello World**:
   I edited the text of the default page adding my name.

## Progress Update: 09/16/2024

This week I have made some progress in researching the project to develop. Last week I chose to use the Next JS framework, with tailwind UI. Currently, I have two ideas to develop:

A website for encryption and decryption of files
The first use-case is a website where users can upload files, and encrypt them through a selected encryption method (examples: RSA, AES, etcâ€¦). The site could also include a way to generate encryption keys and in future implementations offer multiple encryption methods to expand its use case.

The second idea is a website for encryption and decryption of files using steganography.
A web application that hides sensitive data within an image, audio, or other file formats. The user uploads a file and text (or another file) to hide, and the site generates a new file that looks identical but contains hidden information.

For this idea one library available is steganography.js

4. **Goal for next week:**
   - Find research and material for encryption and decryption processes
   - Create a project plan
